<h3>Final projects for CS50</h3>


<h4>This repository contains my final 4 projects of the CS50 course.</h4>

Every project is a new branch (that's how CS50 automatically saves all of their student's projects):

<strong>x/speller</strong> is a program, written in C, that imports a library and document and spellchecks all the words in the document.
